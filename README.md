## CS189-MachineLearning
Homework of CS189 Introduction to Machine Learning in UC-Berkeley.  
The algorithm implemented:  
- [Week1](https://github.com/ZhihaoXu/CS189-MachineLearning/tree/master/homework/week1): `SVM`(using `sklearn`) and `K-fold Cross-Validation`
  - Use `SVM` on the [`MNIST`](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), [`Spam`](https://github.com/ZhihaoXu/CS189-MachineLearning/blob/master/homework/week1/problems/data/spam_data.mat) and [`CIFAR-10`](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) datasets  
    The final accuracy on the test datasets are 0.914, 0.948, 0.245
- [Week2](https://github.com/ZhihaoXu/CS189-MachineLearning/tree/master/homework/week2): No coding task this week
- [Week3](https://github.com/ZhihaoXu/CS189-MachineLearning/tree/master/homework/week3): Gaussian Classifier: `LDA` / `QDA`  
  - Use `LDA` and `QDA` on the [`MNIST`](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and [`Spam`](https://github.com/ZhihaoXu/CS189-MachineLearning/blob/master/homework/week1/problems/data/spam_data.mat) dataset
  - The final accuracy on the test datasets are 0.884, 0.820
- [Week4](https://github.com/ZhihaoXu/CS189-MachineLearning/tree/master/homework/week4): `Logistic Regression` with L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> Regularization  
  - Use `Logistic Regression` on the [`Wine`](https://github.com/ZhihaoXu/CS189-MachineLearning/blob/master/homework/week4/data.mat) data with 6497 data points and 12 features, predict a wine is white or red
  - The final accuracy on the test dataset is 0.98
- [Week5](https://github.com/ZhihaoXu/CS189-MachineLearning/tree/master/homework/week5): `Decision Tree` and `Random Forest`  
  - Use `Decision Tree` and `Random Forest` on the [`Spam`](https://github.com/ZhihaoXu/CS189-MachineLearning/blob/master/homework/week1/problems/data/spam_data.mat) and [`Titanic`](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) dataset
  - The accuracy of `Decision Tree` on the test dataset are 0.8215, 0.813, the accuracy of `Random Forest` are 0.8225, 0.808
- [Week6](https://github.com/ZhihaoXu/CS189-MachineLearning/tree/master/homework/week6): `Neural Network`  
  - Use `Two-Layer` and `Multi-Layer` Neural Network on the [`MNIST`](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset
  - The final accuracy on the test dataset is 0.966
- [Week7](https://github.com/ZhihaoXu/CS189-MachineLearning/tree/master/homework/week7): `Kernel K-means` and `Low-rank Approximation`
