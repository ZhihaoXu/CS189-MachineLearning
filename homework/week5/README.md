Almost all the codes can be simply executed by clicking run in jupyter notebook. 
Here are some remarks of my program:
1. The visualization of decision tree is based on graphviz, please configure the environment properly before executing
2. In visualization, it may return a list of warnings, you can just ignore it. It will not influence the plot of decision tree
3. Other codes can be executed directly, and will not take too much time
